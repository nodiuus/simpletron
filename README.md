# simpletron

I haven't programmed in any language for a while and decided to try to get back into programming.
A friend recommended that I try making an interpreter.

I actually messed up and made a virtual machine instead (IM AN IDIOT)

But anyways...

After some research, I came across this neat little thing called the Simpletron.
It's a little project to understand the basics of assembly programming.

Here it is in all its glory, the Simpletron!!!!!!!!!

### TL;DR i made a crappy assembly language
