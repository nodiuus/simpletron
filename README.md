# simpletron

I haven't programmed in any language for a while and decided to try to get back into programming.
A friend recommended that I try making an interpreter.

After some research, I came across this neat little thing called the Simpletron.
It's a little project to understand the basics of assembly programming.

Here it is in all its glory, the Simpletron!!!!!!!!!
